There was the need to know the 'vibe' of a place at any given point in time. We understand how important and valuable it is to know how crowded a place is. Even more so, during the time of a pandemic and after it passes as well. Through our 'vybe-o-meter', our users can get an estimated percentage of occupancy in real-time for any restaurant that we have listed with us.

The customers who choose to come to the restaurant would be well aware of the 'vybe' and can prepare accordingly. For example, they won't be surprised to have to wait for a table, or maybe someone would rather be happy to visit a less crowded restaurant for a corporate dinner meeting.",Starts immediatelyImmediately,3 Months,1000-1500 /month,9 Jun' 21,0,74 applicants,,,
